# Bugs — active (being implemented)

Bugs currently being worked. Pushed bugs move to
`docs/waiting-acceptance/BUGS.md`; founder-accepted bugs move to
`docs/done/BUGS.md`. See [README.md](README.md) for the lifecycle.

**Keep rows to one line.** Link out for the detail. A row that grows into a
paragraph belongs in a `PLAN-*.md` or a work-item folder — a table cell
holding half a page is unreadable, which is how this file stopped being
useful once already.

## Two namespaces, and only one of them is a work item

**`BUG-XXX` / `FEATURE-XXX` / `TASK-XXX` are the lifecycle IDs.** They are what the
commit convention, the regression-test naming rule and these lifecycle folders
key off (CLAUDE.md §"Bug Management", §"Team Workflow").

**`A-NN` is not a work item.** Those are findings from one audit — the
2026-07-23 contamination sweep in
[BLUEPRINT-AUDIT-2026-07-23.md](../config/BLUEPRINT-AUDIT-2026-07-23.md) — in the same
category as a Codex finding ID. A finding is a *claim that something is wrong*;
it becomes work when it gets a `BUG-`/`FEATURE-` number and a row here.

They were being used as though they were work items — folder names, rows in this
table, gate comments — and then extended with new numbers (A-38, A-39) for
findings that had nothing to do with that audit. Live items were renumbered on
2026-07-30. The audit document and everything in `done/` keep their `A-NN` IDs as
historical provenance, because the Codex review documents argue about findings by
those names and renaming them would break the trail they exist to be.

**Rule going forward:** an `A-NN` reference is a citation of history. If you are
about to work on something, give it a `BUG-`/`FEATURE-` number first.

| # | Bug | Severity | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-023** | `signal-set.sh` swallows a failed journal append, so a mic flip can succeed while its event is silently lost | S2 | Fixing | The journal was a BACKSTOP "read by nothing that makes a decision", and `\|\| true` was correct under that contract. FEATURE-003 made it the replay's SOURCE and did not update the writer. Found by Jesko (Codex) R7: a flip published, its append failed, a later flip succeeded, and `session-resume` reported one event with no warning and exit 0. Durable is not the same as complete — an append-only file nothing truncates can still have holes if its writer treats them as acceptable. |

**Do not narrate status here.** Which items are where is answered by the
folders: `doing/` is what is being implemented, `waiting-acceptance/` is what is
pushed and untested, `done/` is what the founder accepted. Prose repeating that
becomes a second record of one fact, and on 2026-08-03 every such line in this
file had gone false — including one telling the next session that a decision was
still pending on an item accepted that morning. Resume context belongs in
[HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), which is rewritten to match reality on every wake.
