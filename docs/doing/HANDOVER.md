# HANDOVER — what a waking agent needs to TAKE OVER

**Founder rule, 2026-08-05:** *"the file should only contain the data needed for
the next agents that will take something over that is open / wip, all other
things should be documented in the tasks/bugs || commits || md files."*
It is committed with the work that changes the open state (founder, 2026-09-16),
because another machine only sees what is pushed.

| If you want to know… | Read |
|---|---|
| what is open, and what to test | the four `docs/<state>/` folders |
| what changed and why | `git log`: commit bodies carry the reasoning |
| the rules | `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/DoD.md`, `CLAUDE.blueprint.md` (blueprint only) |
| cancelled work and accepted limits | `docs/config/findings.md` |
| host quirks, standing founder decisions | `project_config_overview.md` |

## 0. THE THINGS THAT WILL COST YOU FIRST

1. **Run vitest with the pinned binary and a scrubbed env**, from anywhere:
   `env -u GIT_EDITOR -u GIT_PAGER -u AGENT_PERSONA tests/node_modules/.bin/vitest run --root "$PWD/tests" <suite>`.
   The harness refuses ambient `GIT_*` / `AGENT_*` variables, and the repo root has
   no vitest config.
2. **The gate is fast now** (~30 s): suites run in parallel, five
   `*.release.spec.ts` suites run in CI only, and a push of only `.md` files skips the
   code stages. **CI is the release gate**: `released` moves only on green, and the
   derived projects pull `released`. Always wait for CI after a push.
3. **Check parallel changes on CI-sized hardware.** BUG-133 was green on this
   32-core machine and red on CI's 4 cores. `taskset -c 0-3` reproduces CI's load.
4. **`gh run list --commit` needs the full SHA.** A short one returns nothing and a
   wait loop never ends.
5. **Codex sandboxes cannot write `~/.cache`**: give a Codex reviewer `TMPDIR=/dev/shm`.

## 1. OPEN, AND WHOSE CALL IT IS

### The founder's

- **Acceptance.** Everything in `docs/waiting-acceptance/` (TASK-021, TASK-022,
  TASK-050..058, BUG-083, BUG-133, BUG-134) carries what to test.
- **Model tiers for agents (asked 2026-09-17, unanswered).** The founder added a
  `Model` column to `AGENT_ROSTER.md` and proposed a generic `<tier>:<effort>` form
  (`frontier:high`, `frontier-1:medium`). Codex tiers can be derived from
  `~/.codex/models_cache.json` (listed models, by priority). Claude has no local
  list, so two questions are open:
  1. the Claude order, best first, including where Fable 5.1 goes;
  2. whether `frontier-1` means one step down that list or the previous generation.

  Then build a script that writes `.claude/agents/<persona>.md` with `model:` from
  the roster, and pass `-m` / `-c model_reasoning_effort=` to `codex exec`. Per-
  subagent *effort* for Claude is unverified. Check it before promising it.
  Background: the founder's usage report said 55% of usage came from
  `general-purpose` subagents and 89% ran at >150k context.
- **TASK-049 (backlog):** managed vs project placement for a guard that refuses to
  publish a live handover.

### Nobody's in flight

`docs/doing/` holds no active work. No agent is running.

### Derived projects

storm2flow (session `storm2flow-3b`) was told about the TASK-021 and TASK-022
releases. Its pull still stops on its own `CLAUDE.md` markers and on permission rules
that belong in `.claude/settings.project.json`. That migration is its own work.
linkedin-watcher-agent and struct2flow-www have no reachable session. The first
pull with an old CLI prints one error after "Pulled N file(s)", and a second run is
clean.

## 2. HOW THE ORCHESTRATOR WORKS NOW (decisions of 2026-09-16/17)

- **Judge review findings; don't relay them.** Only real and practical findings
  become work (DoD §1b rule 4). Cross-provider review is for major bugs, core-path
  changes and new features.
- **Replan stale plans before implementing them.** TASK-021 and TASK-022 both were,
  then got one Codex alignment review, then went to the founder for decisions.
- **Spawn fresh agents with narrow briefs**, and cap their reports.
- **Every item named to the founder carries a link and a plain line** (AGENTS.md).
  The founder enforces this.
- **Be critical of the founder and of yourself.** Do not open with agreement.
