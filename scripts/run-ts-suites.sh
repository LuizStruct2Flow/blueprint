# scripts/run-ts-suites.sh — run the TypeScript suites as ONE vitest process,
# and render them as one pipeline stage per suite.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. TASK-018 has two requirements that pull against each other:
#
#   - Parallelism is the point. Forty-two separate `vitest run` invocations means
#     forty-two Node startups and discards it entirely.
#   - The gate must still list every suite. `bootstrap-gate` #3 requires a
#     derived project's gate to pass >= 25 stages as an explicit non-vacuity
#     guard, and the SLO's slowest-stage line has to name something actionable —
#     `slowest: vitest 200s` names nothing (PLAN-TASK-018 §7.3).
#
# So one process runs, and its per-file results are injected as individual
# stages through pipeline.sh's batch API.
#
# THE DECLARATION COMES FROM tests/SUITES.md, NOT FROM VITEST.
#
# This is the load-bearing detail, and Philipp stated the residual risk plainly
# when building the API: if the expected set were derived from the runner's own
# output, every guard would reduce to trusting the runner. A suite silently
# dropped from vitest's include glob would then vanish with the gate still
# green — BUG-005 exactly, and the same door TASK-018 §7.1 just closed in the
# manifest. The manifest owns the list; vitest reports against it; a declared
# suite that does not report FAILS BY NAME.
#
# Usage (from .githooks/pre-push-project, with pipeline.sh already sourced):
#   . scripts/run-ts-suites.sh
#   ts_suites_stage
#
# Exit: 0 when every declared suite reported success, non-zero otherwise. The
# caller does not need to inspect it — failures land in the pipeline tally.

# ts_suites_present — is there anything to run at all?
#
# A project mid-migration, or one that has not installed the toolchain, must get
# a truthful skip rather than a failure. Mirrors tests/manifest's own no-Node
# property: the shell half of this repo keeps working with zero TS present.

# Delegates to scripts/lib/suites.sh. This function used to carry its own copy
# of the manifest table parse, under a comment claiming "two parsers of one
# table drift, and this file exists to be the thing that cannot" — while being
# the second parser. Vitali (QA-1) caught it, and it was already drifting: the
# manifest's copy emits six fields and gates the parallelism class on the last
# two, while this one read field 2 and would have accepted a legacy four-column
# row the manifest rejects.
